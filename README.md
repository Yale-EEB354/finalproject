# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Comparative Phylogeny of Viburnum

## Introduction and Goals
My project is interested in determining if there are differenes in the rate of evolution across the Viburnum phylogeny related to different leaf anatomy and habitat. Viburnum has ancestral H palisade cells which appear with additional arms that increase the surface area. I cells, the traditional columnar palisade cell, have evolved more than once apparently to respond to more direct light. H cells and I cells represent two specific strategies that Viburnum has adopted for light scavening with effects on the overall fitness of the plant. Previous phylogenies of Viburnum have already shown that the lineage has a history of moving out of biomes with biome-specific traits following the transition (Landis et al, 2020). Rates of molecular evolution have been attempted to be linked to life history strategies, but there has not been a consensus (Smith and Donoghue, 2008). Slower carbon accumulation in shade could result in longer generation times and slower relative rates of evolution compared to sun adapted species. 

Working alongside Aleca, I plan to construct an initial maximum liklihood phylogeny using the RadSeq data from the Landis et al project overlayed with H and I cell information. Following this, I will use the liklihood approach described Adams to compare the rate of evolutionary change for phenotypic traits. I would also like to explore how different molecular clocks can impact branch lengths of the phylogeny. To determine this, I would clamp internal nodes to fossil dates, geological events such as Laurasia, and substitution rates and compare the results using a distance measure.
