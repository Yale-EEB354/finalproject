# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Comparing Evolution Rates of Protein Quality Control Genes

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to answer the question, "Do proteases and chaperones evolve at a similar rate?"
This question is prompted by a recent study available on bioRxiv on proteome expansion across the tree of life (Rebeaud et al., 2020). They write extensively about the evolution of chaperones and co-chaperones, but say little about proteases. However, it has been well-catalogued that chaperones and proteases play different (but arguably equally important) roles in maintaining proteostasis in a cell (Gottesman et al., 1997). Furthermore, the network of chaperones and proteases that make up protein quality control (PQC) networks are necessary for cell tolerance of perturbations, and, acting as a mechanism of robustness are thus a driving force of evolution.

The methods I will use to do this are...
I will need to download sequence data for certain PQC genes, align them, and construct a phylogenetic tree. I'm wondering if I can create a tree where each edge represents a specific PQC protein gene. I imagine I would have to collect a lot of sequences of orthologous PQC genes across species and then create some kind of average estimate of its placement with respect to other proteins. I can create the tree using R and iqtree with the methods we have used in class thus far. I can also use R to estimate and compare evolutionary rates of time based on the phylogenies I create. However, I'm not sure yet how I will organize my collection of homologous protein sequences into one input to map on a tree. 

For the purpose of this project, the data I will use are publicly available at NCBI. Some of the most well-studied PQC systems are in E. coli (GroEL, GroES, Lon) so I think that would be a good place to start. However, I would love some input on how far I should expand this question (to other bacteria, other microbes, all animals?) I think it would be really cool to include archaea, since I imagine many extremophiles rely heavily on PQC proteins to keep them alive in gnarly environments! If my study focused on bacteria, maybe archaea could be an outgroup?

I will be limited by what is publicly available, but I hope to implement the methods I learn in this project on my own sequence data as my thesis progresses. This will ultimately be sequence data from nearshore bacterial communities in the Long Island Sound.
