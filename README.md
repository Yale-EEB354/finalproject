# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Comparing Evolution Rates of Protein Quality Control Genes

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to answer the question, "Do proteases and chaperones evolve at a similar rate?"
This question is prompted by a recent study available on bioRxiv on proteome expansion across the tree of life (Rebeaud et al., 2020). They write extensively about the evolution of chaperones and co-chaperones, but say little about proteases. However, it has been well-catalogued that chaperones and proteases play different (but arguably equally important) roles in maintaining proteostasis in a cell (Gottesman et al., 1997). Furthermore, the network of chaperones and proteases that make up protein quality control (PQC) networks are necessary for cell tolerance of perturbations, and, acting as a mechanism of robustness are thus a driving force of evolution.

The methods I will use to do this are...
I will start by gathering protein sequence data on NCBI. I will find a region within Lon protease that has a high consensus with other microbes. 
A protease I will start with is: Lon. 
Then, I will gather protein sequence data on NCBI for a chaperone and co-chaperone.
The chaperone and Co-chaperone I will start with are: GroEL, GroES....

For the minimum viable analysis, I will use the ___________ domain protein sequence from Lon protease to run BLAST and search for homologous regions in other proteases in different bacteria. 
I will upload this data to the Yale computing cluster (Grace), then run IQ-tree to make a phylogenetic tree of the homologous proteases from different bacteria. 

Thus, each edge will represent a specific (homologous) protein region from different bacteria. I will run a bootstrap analysis and label my tree with the bootstrap values. I will also use R to estimate and compare evolutionary rates of time based on the phylogenies I create. 

I will be limited by what is publicly available, but I hope to implement the methods I learn in this project on my own sequence data as my thesis progresses. This will ultimately be sequence data from nearshore bacterial communities in the Long Island Sound. 

## Methods

First, I searched for Lon protease in E coli on NCBI. I selected AAC36871.1 for my query ID and BLASTed it (BLASTP) using the protein database (PDB) for all prokaryotes. 

I selected nine of the most diverse species available from the results and chose the sequences among those species that had the highest coverage from the query.
I downloaded the aligned file in fasta format and updated the header to label Genus_species_SequenceID (lon.renamed.fasta). 
I then uploaded this file to the cluster, as well as two job scripts I had made using MAFFT for alignment and IQtree and analyzation. 

I ran my job scripts, creating an aligned file, then ran IQTREE. 

I created an rmd file and made a phylogenetic tree of my species based on the Lon protease sequences.

THINGS THAT I NEED TO FIX and NEXT STEPS:
My phylogeny doesn't really make sense because I have two E. coli sequences that are mapped sooooo distantly from each other (moreso than everything else). I'm guessing this is an error with a sequence I chose from NCBI (maybe one of them was not truly an E. coli protease sequence, but a sequence from another species that had been transformed into E. coli? I need to take a closer look at these sequences and sequence info on ncbi)

Next, I searched for a GroEL chaperonin on NCBI. I selected WP_000729117.1 for my query ID and BLASTed it (BLASTP) under the same filters as Lon protease: pdb, prokaryotes. 

I also added "filters". My filters were the genus and species names of all bacteria whose sequences I used in my Lon protease analysis. My results yielded sequences for E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Thermus thermophilus. The other species were not found. 

I have six total protein sequences for GroEL, which I aligned and analyzed using MAFFT and IQTREE, with the same job scripts as for Lon protease. 

Next I created two small phylogenetic trees of each of these in Rstudio. I checked to see if the trees were rooted/the same (which I knew they weren't), but this will provide me with useful way to check once I find an appropriate outgroup to add to my trees. This is important so that I can make accurate statements about the divergence rates of chaperones and proteases.

I calculated the edgelengths using phytools and once I properly reroot my trees, I will be able to compare the edgelengths (from root to tip of proteins from the same species) with each other to infer differences in evolution rate.
